s_to=object, w_to=object, e_to=object -- did not work


        print(item, "Item to Add")
        print(type(item), "Type")
        print(item[0].name, "First arg")
        print(type(item[0]), "Type of Arg")
        print("-----------------------------")

had to use print on the on_take and on_drop methods
